# Save-The-DolpinVR-Emulator
Nintendo recently went to "War" with the Dolphin VR emulator. We believe Dolphin is the right, since Nintendo has no VR emulators. This page is dedicated to preserving the Dolphin Emulator. All data donations welcome for the time being.

(no releses of the app have been published yet.)

Worried about the legality of emulators? look no further,(https://github.com/EDKGames1/Save-The-DolpinVR-Emulator/files/12148741/Emulators.Legality.Explained.txt)
